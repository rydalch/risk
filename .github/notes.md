## Cyber Defense
Monitoring and Detecting

Continually observing network and system activity to detect suspicious behaviour and events.

 

These may include, for example, monitoring for logins from another country while the employee is based in the company's London office.

 
Incident Response

The team quickly comes together if suspicious activity is confirmed and alerts are raised.

 

This is when the Incident Response process begins. The process involves containing and removing the threat and restoring the business back to normality.

 
Threat Intelligence

Gathering and using information about attackers—their latest methods, targets, and trends—can greatly strengthen an organisation’s defences.

 

For example, understanding that an attacker focuses on a specific software application used within organisations.

 
Vulnerability Management

Fixing software or system flaws is an important preventative measure that can lower the risk of an attack.

 

Security teams can check which systems attackers are most likely to target. This can be done manually or with the help of automated tools.

 
Investigation and Analysis

Members of a defensive security team are always monitoring and analysing what’s happening inside an organisation.

 

They work to separate normal activity from suspicious behaviour, digging into the details like solving a puzzle to uncover valuable insights.

Exploring the Security Operations Centre (SOC)
Think of a SOC as the defensive security centre for an organisation's technology. This busy centre is the frontline of protecting an organisation, often operating around the clock, 365 days a year, and employs a variety of security professionals who monitor and protect the organisation's networks, systems, and data.

A typical day in the SOC could look like:

Reviewing alerts triggered by security tooling
Investigating anomalies
Responding to incidents
These professionals are often the eyes and ears on the frontline for protecting an organisation.

SIEMs: The Defensive Security Radar
Much like a control centre in the real world, SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management) systems are the central place for all data and information collected from security devices, workstations, servers, and more within an organisation.

Much like radar sweeping the digital environment, these systems are an absolutely critical part of any organisation's defensive security, as they offer insight into what is happening within the organisation's IT.

The systems inside an organisation produce a large amount of information. This information needs to be brought together in one central and easy-to-access place to understand what's happening quickly and clearly. This way, several people can review and analyse it quickly.
