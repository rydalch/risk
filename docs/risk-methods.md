- ## Quantitative Optimization & Decision Science

### Improving Risk Management Comparisons and Decisions

**[SIRACon 2012: Tony Cox - Improving Risk Management Comparisons](https://vimeo.com/53151221)**
- Advanced critique of risk matrices, scoring formulas, and ranking methods
- Demonstrates how standard rating/scoring methods often perform worse than random decision-making
- Proposes quantitative optimization models as superior alternatives
- Practical examples from information security, enterprise risk, and terrorism risk analysis
- Key insight: Better risk reduction at lower cost through mathematical optimization

### Cyentia Institute - IRIS Study (Information Risk Insights Study)

**[IRIS 20/20 - Cyentia Institute](https://www.cyentia.com/iris/)**
- 10 years of historical cyber incident data analysis
- Measures frequency and cost of actual cyber incidents
- Provides evidence-based data for risk assessment beyond "FUD" (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
- Supports quantitative risk modeling with empirical data

### Decision Science Foundation

If risk assessments exist to facilitate informed decision-making, understanding the science behind decision-making becomes essential. Decision science principles should inform how we:
- Design risk assessment methodologies
- Present risk information to stakeholders
- Make resource allocation decisions based on risk data
- Avoid cognitive biases in risk evaluation
