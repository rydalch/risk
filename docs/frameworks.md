- [NIST SSDF](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final): Security practices for software development
  - Practice Groups (PO, PS, PO, PR) covering practices and controls
  - Emphasis on secure development, secure supply chain, and incident management
  - Applicable to commercial and government software

### CIS Software Supply Chain Security Benchmark
